# Smart Home Application

Smart home Application is a sensor based application to control different elements in your home. The Application can accurately read sensor inputs and then use the same application to control appliances at home. The features included in this build are :

  - Thermostat
  - Humidity Detection and Control
  - Smoke Detection
  - Intrusion Detection

# Team Members!
We are a team of students from Harbour.Space Universtiy. 
  - Arjun Nair, Second Year Bachelor, Cyber Security
  - Anouar Meziou, First Year Master, Data Science
  - Pranav Joy, Second Year Bachelor, Cyber Security

Over the period of two-weeks we developed the User Interface and the back-end for the program. The majority of the programming was carried out by Arjun Nair, while the Pranav and Anouar where essential in the primary design of how the program would work, and the different aspects that could affect User Experience.

### Tech

Smart Home Application uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* Netbeans - awesome Java IDE
* Github - Web-based hosting service for version control using Git
* Travis CI - testing and deployment tool
* Dillinger - pretty cool markdown editor

### Installation

Smart Home Application requires Java 8+ to run on your system.

```sh
$ java -jar homeapp.jar
```

### Testing

Since our application is primarily user-based, and requires user input, we decided against the traditional methods of writing tests, but instead focused on user testing. We had users try various commbinations of inputs that is generally encountered in daily use and thus made changes to the program from the user responses.
